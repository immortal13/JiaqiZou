<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student from [State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/en/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hongyan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fq7Uqx0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Prof. Wei He](https://prowdiy.github.io/weihe.github.io/), and [Prof. Liangpei Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vzj2hcYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

**I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities starting in June 2025.**

My research interest includes deep learning, remote sensing, hyperspectral, image processing, and wetland mapping.
